# packimo
A curated vanilla+ Minecraft 1.20.1 Fabric pack. `mods/` contains client and server mods. You need all of them to run the pack locally, but if you're hosting a server, you can drop the client-side mods to save some bytes. I've also included the files necessary to deploy a server on Fly.io (performance-2x, 4GB, $0.0861/hr, ~$10/mo if you run it 4h/day).

## How to Play
Most of the mod is easy to navigate, aside from the LevelZ mod, which significantly slows down game pace (in a good way!) by restricting items and resources behind skills. There are 12 skills that players can develop by allocating skill points that are rewarded upon leveling up (note that core levels and LevelZ levels are separate, but integrated). You can level up by gaining normal XP, *or* by doing **jobs** (e.g. farmer, miner, warrior, etc.). Each player can select up to 2 jobs at a time, and doing tasks related to those jobs (explained in-game) rewards LevelZ XP as well. For example, chopping wood doesn't give core XP, but if you have the lumberjack job selected, you'll get LevelZ XP as you level up that job.

Here are some things that this mod introduces that might take you by surprise when you spawn in:
- Health is a skill, so everybody starts with 3 hearts, and each point you allocate toward the health skill results in an additional half-heart
- You can only use wooden tools when you start; you have to level relevant skills to unlock access to higher tiers of tools
- You can't mine stone or coal until you reach mining level 5
- Furnaces require farming level 1 to use

One of the most effective methods for farming XP in the early game is killing fish as they yield core XP, don't require much risk, and respawn very quickly.
