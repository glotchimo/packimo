# packimo
A curated vanilla+ Minecraft 1.20.1 Fabric pack. `mods/` contains client and server mods. You need all of them to run the pack locally, but if you're hosting a server, you can drop the client-side mods to save some bytes. I've also included the files necessary to deploy a server on Fly.io (performance-2x, 4GB, $0.0861/hr, ~$10/mo if you run it 4h/day).
